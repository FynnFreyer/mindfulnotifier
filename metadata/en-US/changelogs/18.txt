# 1.0.11
- External storage changes (required by Google):
  - Remove android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" to conform to Android 11
  - Remove android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions
- Backup/Restore changes (driven by the above):
  - Backup/Restore now use the application-specific external directory
    - Also given option to share the backup file using Android share facility
      - Share to local file system or cloud service, etc
      - This should be done to ensure the backup is preserved if you ever uninstall the app

# 1.0.21
- Fix UI re-init issue with recreating the initial notification
  when app is revisited after being killed (either on restart
  or when user uses the back button to exit instead of the
  home button)
    - If user presses the back button the app is killed (but
      the alarm service is still running, and notifications
      still occur).
    - This fixes the notification being re-raised/changed
      when the app is again started by the user

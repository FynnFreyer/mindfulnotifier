# 1.0.14
- Rework reminder list UI and features for Issue #15 (tagging) and Issue #20
    - Ability to enable/disable individual reminders
    - Supports simple 'tag' field to categorize groups of reminders
    - Reminder list can be filtered by tag
    - Reminder list is always automatically sorted:
        - Alphabetical
        - Disabled reminders are moved to end of list
- Backup/Restore changed to Reminder Export/Import:
    - No longer does full backup/restore of all settings
        - NOTE: Existing backup files will still work - however, only the reminders will be restored.
    - Core function is changed to provide only reminder export/import
    - Reminder list export/import via JSON file format.
        - See: Issue #20 (simpler file format for reminder sharing)
    - New 'Merge' when importing reminder list:
        - 'Merge' will preserve existing reminders in list; only new reminders are added
        - 'Replace' completely replaces existing reminders list
- Fix issue #11, issue when updating schedule min/max values

- Backup/Restore changes (required by Google before May 5th):
  - Remove unneeded android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" to conform to Android 11
  - Remove unneeded android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions
  - Backup/Restore now use the application-specific external directory
    - Option to share the backup using Android share facility
      - Share to local file system or cloud service, etc

This app is a simple mindfulness-based timer which displays a
notification/reminder at user-defined intervals. It is another
take on a '''Mindfulness Bell''', with the addition of accompanying text.
The reminders are taken from a configurable list, and are chosen
at random at a selected interval. The reminder interval can either
be periodic (in intervals down to a 15 minute granularity) or random
(between a selected range of minutes).

Some default reminders are provided as examples. You can add,
edit, or remove these default reminders as you like.

There are 5 bells included, and you can also configure a custom bell
from your phone's local storage.

This app works very well in conjunction with a smartwatch. In
this mode you can also mute the bell to have silent mindfulness
prompts throughout your day.

## About this app

This app is a simple mindfulness-based timer which displays a 
notification/reminder at user-defined intervals. Reminders are, taken 
from a configurable list. Reminders can be configured
for either periodic (down to 15 minute intervals) or random intervals.
Some default notifications are provided as simple examples. 
You can add and remove from the notifications defaults as you like.
There are 5 bells included, and you can also configure a custom bell
from your phone's local storage.

The app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

It currently only runs on Android.
